# odin-landing-page

My attempt at the Project: Landing Page, as part of The Odin Project's fundamentals. 

Thoughts on completion: 
- Got to grips with flexbox, although still need to drill it in more (especially justify-content for row and align-items for column). Also wonder if I should have used flex: grow at some point (where?)
- Found myself using id's as well as classes in the CSS, even though the tutorial said to avoid them as much as possible. Note to self: Look back on this when you're a little further along. What is redundant in the CSS, what can be grouped toghether to avoid redundancies and repetition. 
- Got into something of a habit of adding/committing/pushing to git, although still felt like I wasn't quite doing it right (?). Note to self: look at some other repos, get more of a sense how often commits are made and how they are worded.
